Example LED Project

Hello, if you're using Python code on the Raspberry Pi Pico platform, you can refer to our provided demo codes. 
There are example programs for displaying images in the code. Of course, you can also import other images, but you need to pay attention to the format of the images. 
You can refer to the images in the demo codes folder you downloaded for the image format. 
You can download the demo codes from the following link: [demo codes download link](https://seengreat.com/wiki/73/rgb-matrix-p3-0-64x32).
Additionally, your LED matrix screen is provided by Waveshare.
